I am learning how to implement jQuery in tandem with javaScript to render my HTML dynamically based on user interaction.
My HTML is basically a skeleton, with not much more than metadata and links to our resources.
The app should welcome the user, provide 5 questions with feedback between each as to whether they were correct/incorrect,
they cannot advance questions without selection & submission, must maintain view of current question/score,
and finally recieve the results of their selections with an option to restart the quiz.
