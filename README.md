/**This is the quiz App required for submission in lesson 10 of 'Interactive Web Apps'.
We are learning how to implement jQuery in combo with javaScript to render our HTML dynamically based on user interaction.
Our HTML is basically a skeleton, with not much more than metadata and links to our resources.
The app should welcome the user, provide 5 questions with feedback between each as to whether they were correct/incorrect,
they cannot advance questions without selection & submission, maintain view of current question/score,
and finally recieve the results of their selections with an option to restart the quiz.**/
